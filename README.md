# SDG Apps Privacy Policy

## Data Storage

All data used by an SDG Apps mobile application (hereafter "App") is used strictly for the operation of the App; for example, text data used by the app, or a log of recently selected text passages for user convenience.  Data is stored entirely on the mobile device running the app (hereafter "Device").  The App will use a local database located on the Device (hereafter "DB") to store and retrieve any data used by the App on the Device.  In some cases, an App will communicate with another App using a shared DB, only on the same Device.

## Data Collection

An App will never collect sensitive information from the user, including any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  An App will never share its data with, nor have its data collected by, SDG Apps or any of its affiliates.  An App will never share its data with, nor have its data collected by, another Device running an App.

## About SDG Apps

SDG Apps is a private, non-profit enterprise supplying utility mobile applications out of spare time development efforts.  At time of writing, it has no servers on which to store any user data; at such time as it expands to include hosting servers, this document will be updated to reflect any pertinent changes.  SDG Apps deeply respects the privacy of its Apps' users, and will never collect or sell any user information without their express prior consent.
