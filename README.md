# SDG Apps Privacy Policy

SDG Apps do not collect any of your data.  The apps' functionality is provided as a free service and does not in any way make use of your personal information.  We do not keep track of what you are reading, memorizing, mapping, or eating.  The only database operations that occur are on your personal device.  I would like to say your data is safe with us, but I cannot -- because it is not with us to begin with!  Enjoy your privacy.
